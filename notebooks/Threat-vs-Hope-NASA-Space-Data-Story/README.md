# Threat vs Hope — NASA Space Data Story

Space does not send a single, simple message. One side of the universe throws rocks past Earth, some of them skimming close enough to remind us how small and fragile our world is. The other side quietly hides distant planets that might one day feel like a second home, orbiting faraway stars we can barely see.

In this notebook, both sides are introduced:

- **Near-Earth Objects**: Highlighting how many dangerous rocks are out there, how large they are, and how close they come to Earth.  
- **Exoplanets**: Each row represents a distant planet with radius, temperature, and other properties that hint at how Earth-like it might be.

## Story Objectives

This project explores two datasets representing contrasting aspects of space — danger and hope — and analyzes them to extract meaningful insights.  

**Datasets:**

- **NEO (Threat):** Each row is an asteroid that approached Earth, with size, close-approach distance, and a hazardous flag. Together, they map the background level of danger in our cosmic neighborhood.  
- **Exoplanets (Hope):** Each row is a distant planet with radius, temperature, and other properties that hint at how Earth-like it might be.

**Main Objectives:**

1. Perform an initial exploration of each dataset: examine shapes, data types, missing values, and basic distributions.  
2. Clean and standardize the data to ensure numeric columns, proper types, and handle missing or inconsistent values.  
3. Create derived metrics or scores that highlight important characteristics (e.g., `threat_score` for NEOs, habitability indicators for exoplanets).  
4. Summarize and group data by relevant categories to extract meaningful patterns or trends.  
5. Visualize key distributions, relationships, and comparisons with clear titles, labels, and color coding.  
6. Highlight insights that tell a clear story about potential dangers from NEOs and promising features of exoplanets.

Provide a narrative-driven exploration of space: highlighting the risks of nearby asteroids while inspiring curiosity about distant worlds that could one day harbor life.
